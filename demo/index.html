            <p>The purpose of this survey and quiz is to collect data on how people’s opinions relate to
              their knowledge of other people’s opinions. We will use this data in ongoing academic research.
              Our research is publicly funded and results will be made available for free to the general
              public. Your responses may therefore be made public in anonymous form.
            </p>
            <p>In order to claim payment from Mechanical Turk you are required to answer quiz and survey
              questions to the best of your ability. After answering, you will be shown your own score and
              correct answers to the questions. This is for interest only. <b>Your quiz score will not affect
                payment in any way however other attention checks are present which must be passed in order to
                receive payment. </b>
             </p>
             <p> <b>At the end of the survey you will be given a completion code which you must paste back
               into Mechanical Turk to enable us to pay you.</b>
             </p>
             <p>We hope you find the quiz fun and informative :-) </p>

             <ul>The researchers are:
               <li>Student: Regan Jones, Department of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University. </li>
               <li>Supervisor: Crispin Cooper, Research Fellow, Sustainable Places Research Institute, Cardiff University.</li>
             </ul>

             <p>Should you have any questions, we are contactable via your Amazon Mechanical Turk dashboard. </p>
             <p><b>The survey includes questions of a sensitive nature, including personal opinions on
               sensitive topics, and protected characteristics such as your ethnic background.</b>
             </p>
             <p><b>To enable payment we must assign you a random survey completion code and store this with
               your responses. We will use this only for the purpose of approving payment via Amazon, who link
               it to your Mechanical Turk Worker ID in order to pay you. Once payment has been processed we
               will remove your completion code from our records, making your responses fully anonymous. </b>
             </p>
             <p>During the survey we also place a cookie on your machine, which is read only by the survey
               pages and expires after 7 days.
